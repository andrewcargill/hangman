# Harry's Hangman
Harry's hangman is an educational english learning game for young people and adults. The game takes the player on a journey to try and save Harry's life by guessing letters to complete a mystery word.

Each step of the way the play reads and then responds to text on the screen to try and complete the mission. Lovely custom graphics help to keep the player engaged with the game and keep them coming back for more. 

Currently, the player can choose from either colour or animal words to guess, this will be expanded with a future update.
